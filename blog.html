<p><strong>What the Health?! Availability for Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether you are a vegan, vegetarian, have dietary restrictions based on religion, diseases, allergies, etc., the University of Tampa has options for you, or at least they try to. Pretty much every dining option on campus has vegetarian options (even if that option is just a side like fries or rice), but it is extremely limited. You can speak to dining services if you require special accommodations regarding allergies but many students (myself included) think that the university needs to have a wider range of options for people who do not stick to a mainstream unlimited diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to needing more options for alternative dietary lifestyles, most students agree that the university needs more options for students who prioritize health and nutrition over a quick bite. While UT does offer some healthier options and ways to build a nutritious meal, most dining options are fried carb heavy meals that are not conducive to everyday healthy eating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s the Cost?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Students who reside on campus have 3-4 options for meal plan but are required to have at lease one. They range in price from $1692 to $3136 per semester with a varying number of meals per week from different on campus eateries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who live off campus and still want to grab a bite to eat between classes or before heading home, there are also plans available for you. They range in price from $195 to $420 per semester also with a varying amount t of meals for the entire semester.</p>
<p>The university also offers “UT” dollars that are equivalent to their dollar amount ranging from $50 to $499 dollars. Unlike the meal plans and spartan dollars, UT dollars never expire and can be used at any eatery on campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
